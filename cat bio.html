<p> <br> <br> Everyone knows how obsessed I am with my cat, so here's a biography about her! :)
<br> <br> My cat's name is <b>Frosty Rasheed</b>. She was born on July 14th, 2013 and is currently 3 years old. We got her from the Prince William Animal Shelter, where she was playing in her cage with her older brother. Frosty is a domestic cat, who is black and white. She absolutely LOVES papers, and therefore is always ready to play with paper balls and lay on your papers while you are doing your work. Another one of her favorite things to do is sit in boxes, whether she fits in them or not. No matter what, she loves to cuddle and relieve your stress whenever you need her! </p>
