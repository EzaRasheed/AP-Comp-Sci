<p> <br> Hi! My name is <b>Eza Rasheed</b>. I am 18 years old and a senior at Osbourn Park High School. I was born on February 17, 1999 in Pakistan. I moved to America when I was five years old, and I started my education here. My household consists of my parents, my sister, me, and my cat. A weird fact about me is that I am the pickiest eater in the world. I don't eat anything with cheese (yes, that includes pizza), nor do I enjoy Italian or Mexican food. I know, people hate for me for this. Another weird thing about me is that I have an obsession with eating ice. 
It just tastes so good for some reason! An intersting fact about me is that I can make a three leaf clover with my tongue, so if you ever meet me, I can show you! Some other random facts about me are that I LOVE cats, and my all time favorite chips are hot cheetos! Can't live without either! My favorite singers are Adam Levine and the Weeknd. Check out the rest of my website for more! :D </p>
