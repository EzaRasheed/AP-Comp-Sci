<p> <br> <br> After all my hard work in high school, everything paid off when I got my acceptance into my dream college, the <b>University of Virginia</b>, on March 22, 2017. It's going to be hard to leave my family and live independently, but atleast the drive is only 2 hours away. I plan on majoring in Computer Science through the College of Arts and Sciences. It's going to be tough, but I hope everything works out. I am both excited and nervous to leave, but I know the college experience will all be worth it once I get there. I cannot wait to decorate my dorm with my roommate and enjoy numerous of adventures with her! At this point, I am impatiently waiting for the next big step in my life at UVA, with great friends and memorable experiences! Wahoowa! <p>
